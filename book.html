          <br>
          <p class="text-justify">"Heading to the hospital. November 30, 2011, 9:45 am.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Before getting into the ambulance I ask the paramedic where we are going. He tells me Vancouver General Hospital. 
          I sense something very serious is happening to Doug. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be taking him to the nearest hospital. 
          Fortunately, this morning there is no rain and little traffic, so we can move pretty fast. 
          This is the first time I’ve travelled in an ambulance and I feel no fear, despite our speed. The driver inspires confidence in me. More than once, he turned to look at me with a compassionate smile and there was even a moment when he asked me how I felt. 
          We are not far from the hospital; maybe fifteen minutes away at this speed. 
          Doug is back. 
          I can't see him, but I know he's safe. I feel fascinated by the scene, riding shotgun beside the driver and watching the cars pulling over for us. 
          It's a strange feeling ... I never would have imagined a situation like this. I hope it’s not as serious as it appears. Doug has always been very healthy. 
          Only yesterday, we went to our general practitioner and he diagnosed Doug with the flu. However, since Doug began to get sick my intuition told me that it was more than that."</p>   

          <img src="assets/images/bookphoto2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"> <br><br>

          <p class="text-justify">"I hate hospitals. 
          I call my friend Graciela. We have been friends since we lived in Mexico. She knows my story. She has shared with me some definitive moments in my life. I need her. 
          She gets worried when she hears we're going to the hospital. It calms me to know she will leave her house right away to find me. 
          I am surprised at how quickly Doug is taken out of the ambulance and into Emergency. 
          He seems to have fainted. 
          His blue shirt is torn from his resisting the paramedics when they tried to put him on the stretcher. Doug is about seven feet tall and strong. 
          The paramedics enter one of the rooms and leave him on a bed. Several doctors and nurses start running around him. 
          I stand there unnoticed until a nurse sees me and asks me to go to the waiting room. 
          I obey her because I don't know what else to do. I think Doug might have to stay in the hospital all day. 
          He looks bad. How can a simple cold develop in such an aggressive way? It hurts me he is suffering."</p>

      <div class="growing text-center">
          <h3>I felt broken</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">"After a few moments, I am relieved to see Graciela's familiar figure among the group waiting for medical attention next door. I share with her the story about our GP’s diagnosis, and his prescribing some headache pills that were ultimately useless. Graciela, worried, listens to me raptly. She doesn't say much, but hugs me and asks me to sit. She brings me a glass of water, insisting that I drink it. I follow her advice and start feeling a little better. We both stay seated for awhile. One of the advantages of a long-standing friendship is the lack of need to fill gaps of silence. Simple mutual presence is enough. I distract myself by tearing my paper cup into fragments, while Graciela quietly watches me. Moments later, I decide to go see how Doug is, despite staff admonitions. 
          He is not there anymore. </p>
          <p class="text-justify">I ask the first nurse I find to help me locate him. 
          She calls another nurse and the two, trying to be kind, lead me into a corner. 
          They tell me they changed his room because he had stopped breathing on his own. 
          To save him, they had to put him on artificial respiration. He had fallen into a coma. 
          It’s hard for me to take in the severity of the situation, which is evolving much faster than I can follow it. 
          One of the nurses shows me where Doug is, in a room isolated from the rest. 
          I run there." </p>
